# Team Success Recognition System (TSRS) – Test Plan

## 1. Introduction
This test plan outlines the strategy, scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and test cases for validating the Team Success Recognition System (TSRS) as a Microsoft Teams app, as described in the Product Requirements Document (PRD). The goal is to ensure the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, providing a robust, secure, and user-friendly experience for all user personas within Microsoft Teams.

## 2. Test Objectives
- Verify all user stories and acceptance criteria are met, including Teams-specific features.
- Ensure role-based access and permissions function correctly within Teams.
- Validate Teams app integrations, notifications, and analytics.
- Confirm usability, security, and performance standards on Teams desktop and mobile.

## 3. Test Scope
### In Scope
- Functional testing of all user stories (US-001 to US-020) in the context of Microsoft Teams
- Role-based access control
- UI/UX validation (Teams tabs, messaging extensions, bots, mobile)
- Integration with HR and Microsoft Teams
- Notification mechanisms (Teams in-app, email, push)
- Security and authentication (Microsoft 365/Teams SSO)
- Analytics and reporting
- Budget and reward management

### Out of Scope
- Third-party system testing (outside integration points)
- Hardware compatibility beyond Teams-supported devices

## 4. Test Types
