# Team Success Recognition System (TSRS) – Test Plan

## 1. Introduction
This test plan outlines the strategy, scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and test cases for validating the Team Success Recognition System (TSRS) as described in the Product Requirements Document (PRD). The goal is to ensure the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, providing a robust, secure, and user-friendly experience for all user personas.

## 2. Test Objectives

- Ensure role-based access and permissions function correctly.
- Validate system integrations, notifications, and analytics.
- Confirm usability, security, and performance standards.

## 3. Test Scope
### In Scope
- Functional testing of all user stories (US-001 to US-020)
- Role-based access control
- UI/UX validation (web and mobile)
- Integration with HR and communication tools
- Notification mechanisms (in-app, email, push)
- Security and authentication
- Analytics and reporting
- Budget and reward management

### Out of Scope
- Third-party system testing (outside integration points)
- Hardware compatibility beyond specified devices

## 4. Test Types
- **Unit Testing**: Validate individual components/services.
- **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between modules and external systems.
- **System Testing**: End-to-end validation of workflows.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Real user scenarios and feedback.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure new changes do not break existing features.
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- **Performance Testing**: Load, stress, and responsiveness.

## 5. Test Environment
- Web browsers (latest Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile devices (iOS, Android)
